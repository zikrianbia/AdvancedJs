Avoid Side Effects, Functional purity.
<br>
Example of Side Effects:
<br>
![side effects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71943838/106363749-08762180-635d-11eb-8d71-e7e71a79fdcf.png)
<br>
let a = 1
<br>
function b() {
<br>
    a = 2
<br>
}

that's function doing something that effect outside world.
<br>
think a function as its own universe.
